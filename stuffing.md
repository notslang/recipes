# Stuffing

## Ingredients

- 2.5 lbs high-quality sandwich bread or soft Italian or French bread (about 2 loaves), cut into 3/4-inch dice (about 5 quarts)
- 8 tablespoons butter (1 stick; 4 ounces; 115g)
- 1.5 lbs sage sausage, removed from casing
- 1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
- 4 large ribs celery, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane grater
- 0.25 cup minced fresh sage leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried sage leaves)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed (see note)
- 1 quart low-sodium homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock (4 cups; 1L), divided
- 3 large eggs
- 0.25 cup minced parsley leaves, divided

## Steps

Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions. Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool.

Increase oven temperature to 350°F (180°C).

In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides (do not allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes.

Add sausage and mash with a stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes.

Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.

Whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous.

Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture.

Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed.

To cook stuffing, transfer to a buttered 9x13-inch rectangular baking dish (or 10- by 14-inch oval dish), cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer reads 150°F (66°C) when inserted into center of dish, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.

## Notes

Using finer-holed white bread instead of a more open-structured artisanal loaf means better flavor absorption and retention.

Bread that's been dried out in a low oven is more absorbent than stale bread.

The stuffing can be prepared until the point where it is placed in a buttered baking dish a day in advance. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the stuffing to come to room temperature for at least 1 hour before baking the next day.
