# Chicken Tinga

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs skinless chicken thigh (bone-in or boneless)
- 2-5 canned chipotle peppers
- 1-14.5-ounce can of fire-roasted tomatoes
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 chopped onion
- 3 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp Mexican oregano
- black pepper
- chili powder
- a whole bay leaf
- smoked paprika

## Steps

Combine ingredients in slow cooker.

Let it braise on low for ~6 hours or high for ~3 hours

Remove the chicken to cool. Set the Crock Pot to high.

Use an immersion blender to turn the braising liquid into a smooth sauce.

Shred the chicken with your hands and return it to the bubbling sauce.

Serve chicken as part of nachos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, or enchiladas.

## Notes

If using an instant pot, you can cook this under pressure for as little as 15 minutes. If you've got one of the really fancy ones, you can even sear the chicken and onions in the pot before braising.
