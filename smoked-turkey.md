# Smoked Turkey

## Ingredients

- 16 cups (1 gallon) water
- 0.5 cup sugar
- 1 tbsp molasses
- Rind of 1 navel orange
- 3 sprigs rosemary
- 1 cup kosher salt
- 3 yellow onions, quartered
- 2 heads garlic, halved
- 1 (12-pound) turkey
- 2 lemons, quartered
- 10 sprigs thyme
- 10 sprigs sage
- 1 cup chopped potatoes
- 0.25 cup olive oil
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Garlic powder

## Steps

### Brining

Pour the water into a large bowl.

Add the sugar, molasses, orange rind, rosemary, salt, two-thirds of the quartered onions, and 1 halved garlic head.

Mix until the sugar and salt dissolve.

Remove the giblets from inside the turkey and reserve for another use. Rinse the turkey well.

Place the turkey in a 2.5 gallon resealable plastic bag or any container
that is large enough to hold the turkey and the liquid.

Pour the brine over the turkey, making sure it's completely covered. Refrigerate for 12 hours, turning occasionally.

## Smoking

Soak 4 cups of hickory chips in water in a medium bowl for 1 hour.

Remove the turkey from the brine, rinse well to remove the brining liquid, and pat dry with paper towels. Discard the brining liquid and solids.

Stuff the turkey with the lemon quarters, the remaining halved garlic head and onion, thyme, sage, and potatoes.

Brush the turkey with olive oil and season with pepper and garlic powder.

Scatter 1 cup of the hickory chips over the hot coals and, using barbecue mitts, place the Plate Setter, legs up, in the EGG.

Place the turkey on the V-Rack and put the V-Rack in the Drip Pan.

Place the Drip Pan on the Plate Setter and close the lid of the EGG.

Cook for 2.5 hours, adding more chips every 30 minutes.

If the turkey starts to brown too quickly, carefully tent the turkey with aluminum foil. Continue cooking until the instant read thermometer registers 165F.

Remove the turkey from the EGG and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Carve and serve immediately. Serves 8
