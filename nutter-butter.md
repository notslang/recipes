# Nutter Butter

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 2 cups/256 grams all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 4 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 pound/454 grams (4 sticks) salted butter, at room temperature
- 0.66 cup/180 grams creamy peanut butter, preferably Skippy
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp molasses
- 2 large eggs
- 1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 0.33 cup/47 grams coarsely chopped peanuts
- 2.5 cups/223 grams quick-cooking oats

### Filling

- 0.5 lbs (2 sticks) salted butter, at room temperature
- 1 cup/270 grams creamy peanut butter, preferably Skippy
- 3.33 cups/410 grams confectioners' sugar

## Steps

Heat oven to 350 degrees.

In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and baking soda; set aside.

Using a mixer with a paddle attachment, cream together the butter and peanut butter.

Add sugar, molasses, and beat at medium speed for 4 minutes, scraping down bowl twice.

At low speed, add eggs one at a time and vanilla.

Add flour mixture and mix at low speed until well combined, scraping down bowl as necessary.

Add peanuts and oats, and mix well.

Using an ice cream scoop 1½ inches in diameter (about 1 heaping tablespoon), place balls of dough on parchment-lined baking sheets at least 2 ½ inches apart.

Bake until cookies have spread and turned golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Remove from oven and set aside to cool and firm up on the baking sheet, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely before filling.

Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, peanut butter and confectioners' sugar until very smooth.

To assemble cookies, spread a thin layer (about 1/8 inch) on underside of a cookie. Sandwich with another cookie, being careful not break them. Repeat.

## Notes

Traditional oats can be used in place of quick cooking oats, if they're chopped up in a food processor.
