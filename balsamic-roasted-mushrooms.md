# Balsamic Roasted Mushrooms

## Ingredients

1 lb mushrooms
1 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
salt
2 cloves garlic
1/4 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
Fresh parsley (for garnish - optional)

## Steps

Preheat oven to 425 degrees, and line a baking sheet (with a rim) with parchment paper.

Wash mushrooms, dry, and trim stems.

If mushrooms are large, cut in half, or quarter if they're huge.

Add oil, vinegar, garlic, thyme, salt and pepper to a mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.

Add mushrooms and toss to ensure mushrooms are coated. Spread out on baking sheet (or baking dish) and scatter butter throughout mushrooms.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, giving the pan a shake (or stirring the mushrooms) about halfway through.

If desired, sprinkle with fresh minced parsley before serving.
