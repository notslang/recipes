# Peanut Butter Blossom Cookies

## Ingredients

- 1.75 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 4 ounces (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
- 0.5 cup smooth peanut butter (or other creamy nut butter)
- 1 cup granulated sugar, plus more for rolling
- 0.5 tbsp molasses
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Nonstick spray or vegetable oil for cookie sheet (optional)
- 5 dozen (one 11-ounce package) Hershey’s Kisses, foil removed

## Steps

1. Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
2. Using an electric mixer, cream together butter, peanut butter, 1 cup granulated sugar and molasses.
3. Add egg, milk and vanilla; beat until well blended.
4. Gradually add flour mixture, mixing thoroughly. If the dough is very soft, refrigerate for about 1 hour.
5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
6. Spray, oil or line a cookie sheet with nonstick liner and set aside.
7. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Use nitrile gloves when rolling to keep your hands clean and minimize sticking. Aim for 20 grams of dough in each ball.
8. Roll cookies in sugar and place 2 inches apart on cookie sheet.
9. Bake until very light brown and puffed, 8 minutes.
10. Remove sheet from oven and lightly press a candy kiss into center of each cookie, allowing it to crack slightly.
11. Return to oven until light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven, cool completely and store in an airtight container.
