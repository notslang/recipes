# White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies

## Ingredients

### Dry

- 255g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 0.5 tsp salt

### Wet

- 1.5 cup granulated sugar
- 0.75 cup unsalted butter, melted + slightly cooled
- 1 tbsp molasses
- 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
- 1.5 tsp pure vanilla extract

### Finishing

- 1 heaping cup white chocolate chips
- 1 cup roughly chopped macadamia nuts

## Instructions

Whisk dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Set aside.

Whisk wet ingredients together until combined. Pour into dry ingredients and mix everything together with a rubber spatula until completely combined. Fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. (You can use a mixer for this step if needed.)

Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 4 days. If chilling for longer than 2 hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 20-30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.

Roll cookie dough into balls, about 30g of dough per cookie, and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look soft.

Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.

Make Ahead Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Allow to come to room temperature then continue with step 4. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.

Macadamia Nuts: I used salted dry-roasted macadamia nuts. You can use unsalted, raw, and/or whichever macadamia nuts you love most. Salted dry-roasted adds incredible flavor though.
