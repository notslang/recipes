# Eggnog Without Alcohol

## Ingredients

- 8 large egg yolks
- 0.5 cup granulated sugar
- 1.5 cup heavy cream
- 2 cups whole milk
- 0.5 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- pinch of salt
- 0.25 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ground cinnamon, for topping

## Steps

Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a medium bowl until light and creamy.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the cream, milk, nutmeg and salt. Stir often until mixture reaches 140F.

Add a big spoonful of the hot milk to the egg mixture, whisking vigorously. Repeat, adding a big spoonful at a time, to temper the eggs.

Once most of the hot milk has been added to the eggs, pour the mixture back into the saucepan on the stove.

Whisk constantly for a minute or so, until the mixture reaches 170F on a thermometer. It will thicken more as it cools.

Remove from heat and pour the eggnog through a fine mesh strainer into a pitcher or other container and cover with plastic wrap.

Refrigerate until chilled. It will thicken as it cools.

Stir in the vanilla.

Serve with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg, and fresh whipped cream, if desired.

Store homemade eggnog in the fridge for up to one week.
