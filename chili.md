# Chili

## Ingredients

- bell peppers (green, red, yellow, whatever gives a nice color)
- several cans of kidney beans (sometimes dark, sometimes light)
- small can of tomato paste
- couple cans of diced or crushed tomatoes
- a few pounds of meat (beef or venison)
- celery
- a couple onions
- several spoons of minced garlic

Sometimes I add diced jalapenos (if you like the heat) and sometimes I add dark chocolate (although I'm not convinced it makes a huge difference in flavor).

## Ingredients - Spices

- 6 tbsp chili powder
- 3 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp ground oregano
- 2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp salt
- red pepper flakes
- parsley

## Steps

Brown the meat.

Add in all the other ingredients & spices.

## Notes

No need to drain the fat after browning the ground beef or whatever meat you're using either.

You don't need to drain your cans of beans. You can just dump them in as-is. The extra starch is actually helpful for thickening.
